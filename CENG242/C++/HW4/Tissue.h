		* Creates an R-Tree hierarchy as follows:
			- Each microorganism given in the @param is put into minimum 
			  bounding rectangle.
			- At the bottom level of tree the individual bounding rectangles 
			  of the microorganisms will be placed into the leaves.
			- On one level up, the overlapping bounding rectangles at the lower 
			  level are bounded with a minimum bounding rectangle and these 
			  larger rectangles are put into the nodes. Note that there may be 
			  more than two rectangles overlapping at the lower level and these 
			  may not be overlapped all each other. Namely, bounding rectangle 
			  A may be overlap with rectangle B, and B may overlap with rectangle 
			  C, but A may not overlap with C. Still, A, B and C all will be 
			  bounded with the same minimum rectangle, say D, and this embracing 
			  rectangle D will be put into one level up of A, B, C. Hierarchically, 
			  D will be parent, and A, B and C will be children of D.
			- At the higher levels the same procedure is applied. Finally, in 
			  the root, there will be the the largest Tissue object embracing all.
			- Attention to the following!: Let A, B, C, D, E, F and G be in the
			  same level of the tree. Let A, B, and C overlap somehow, call the 
			  minimum bounding rectangle of those as X. Similarly, let D, E, F
			  and G overlap and call the minimum bounding rectangle of those as Y.
			  Assume that none of A, B and C overlaps with any of D, E, F and G.
			  However, the resulting bounding rectangles X and Y may overlap. In
			  this case, the overlap of X and Y are handled in one level up!
			  (Namely, we do NOT take the minimum bounding rectangle of A, B, C, D,
			  E, F and G directly. We first take those of A, B, C (which is X)
			  and those of D, E, F and G  (which is Y) separately while going up
			  to one level up. Then, we take the minimum bounding rectangle of X 
			  and Y in the next level while going up to one more level up.)
			- It may happen that a rectangle may not overlap/intersect with any 
			  other rectangle at some level. In this case, you should put it into
			  a minimum bounding rectangle of the same size with itself in one
			  level up. Only, in the highest level, if X, Y, ... and Z are the
			  rectangle nodes which are never intersecting with each other, you
			  should put them all in a single bounding rectangle R, and terminate
			  by making R root.
