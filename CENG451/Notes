#week 2

Uml
Modeling
Writing code in an understandable way(variable name vs..)

Modelingle alakalı bir proje oluşturcagız sanırım.

#week 3

UML is engineering level solution not the language level

Design Patterns

#week 4

how to model software system

oop - inheritance - polymorhism 
Modeling
drawing models to "understand"

How much Details ?
how many items human brain can understand (together) ? (given at the same time)
solution: divide the details into parts to understand and not understand all of them at the same time. learn what you need at the first place not all of them.

how to divide ? -> hiyakarki(hiyararşi)
top down,

#week 5

fundamental oop concepts
	encapsulation(info hiding): data and func. packed together
	inheritance: base class
	polymorphism: same func name with diff. actiong on diff classes
		Dynamic "binding" is choosing which implementation of a method will be called at runtime (late binding ? )

7-2 rule ?

object based languages = visual basic 1.0, fortran 90, ada, c

in c we can put functions in struct but not directly

c allow overloading
what is the first language that allows overloading in history? A = B + K

messages, ata used it first
	four parts
	identity of the recipient object
	code to be executed by the recipient
	arguments for the code
	return value
relations, -> 4
	inheritance , association, composition and aggregation

#week 6 

Polymorhism depends on Inheritance depends on Encapsulation

data/function seperation

Polymorhism and inheritance(again)

# 7
Polymorhism
Multiple Inheritance

#8

Multiple Inheritance
Name conflict
Diamond (Inheritance)problem ? not solvable, undefined
over-abstraction

Problems in Classification (animal carniv, herbiv etc)
Non-prioritized Classificatiion Criteria
Object Based Media
	visual basic
	ada
inheritance/compositon

#9

System/subsystem structure
SUBSYTEM İN UML
COSEML
Language Dependency

#10
Language Dependency
	Modeling should consider coding language, from the beginning
